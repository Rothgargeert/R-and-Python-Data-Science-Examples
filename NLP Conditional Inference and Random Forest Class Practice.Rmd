## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library (Rling)
library (party)
```

```{r}
##r chunk
data(caus)

reduced_data = subset(caus,
                   Cx == "make_V" | Cx == "have_V" | Cx == "cause_toV")
reduced_data$Cx = droplevels(reduced_data$Cx)
```


```
```{r}
```{r}
##r chunk
#start with a random number generator
set.seed(549354)

#generate a tree
tree.output = ctree(Cx ~ CrSem + CeSem + CdEv + Neg + Coref + Poss, 
                    data = reduced_data)
```

```

```{r}
```{r}
##r chunk

```
```{r}

```
```{r}

```


```{r}
```{r}

```
```{r}
```{r}
